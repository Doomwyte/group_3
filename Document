Abstract:

Random Encounters is a web application that allows gamers to meet and connect with other gamers in their area. Instead of going on quests and adventures with strangers you’ll never meet halfway across the world, Random Encounters helps gamers find friends near their area to buddy up and slay dragons with. Users can create and customize their own profile pages, use the Google Maps API to search for other gamers around them, and leave comments on each other’s profile pages to communicate. Random Encounters also showcases various features, such as the ability to upload and watch livestreams of games encoded from Twitch, and a New Users page that lists out recently joined users to allow users to welcome the new recruits aboard.

Customer:
